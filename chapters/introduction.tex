% Introduce a bit of the bigger picture and relate it to GW
Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity, born over a century ago, revolutionised the way we think about gravity. What was once thought of as an attractive force between two massive bodies has now been realised as a innate property of spacetime and its influence on the journeys taken by its travellers. While this discovery has far reaching implications throughout the theory of physics and our understanding of our Universe, this thesis focuses on a particular consequence of general relativity; the existence of gravitational waves.
