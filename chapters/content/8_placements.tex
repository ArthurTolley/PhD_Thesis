As a DISCnet funded PhD student I was required to do two 3-month placements in private companies. These placements were helpful in informing my career decisions post-PhD and also for developing my skills for use in my research projects during my PhD. Section~\ref{sec:shell} briefly details my employment at Shell Research UK, including my placement within the organisation, an outline of the work undertaken while there and the skills I developed. Section~\ref{sec:MCA} details the same but for my second placement withing the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, a public sector agency within the UK Government.
