As a DISCnet funded PhD student I was required to undertake two 3-month placements in industry companies. These placements were instrumental to my success as a PhD student: the skills, knowledge and change in environment drove me to learn more in those $6$ months than some years in the PhD. These placements also helped inform my career decisions and what I want to do post-PhD.

In this chapter I will briefly describe the details of my employment and projects undertaken during the two placements. Due to non-disclosure agreements, private information and the passing of time I am not able to provide many details or figures representing exactly what I did during my time. Section~\ref{8:sec:shell} details my time at Shell Research UK and section~\ref{8:sec:MCA} my time at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, a civil service agency within the UK Government.

I was hired as a Data Scientist Intern at Shell and placed within the Predictive Maintenance team. The broad remit of the team is to use advanced data science techniques to predict the maintenance requirements of the many machines located at Shell sites globally to prevent the down-time associated with unplanned disruptions caused by failing machine components.

% Description of what predictive maintenance is
A machine may refer to something as simple as a pump to something as complex as an entire refinery. Each component of these machines contains many sensors for different operating parameters and each value being measured forms a dimension in the data set pertaining to the operational health of a machine. A simple relationship between temperature change over a long period of time might indicate a failure mode of the machine with a predicted timeline to failure. The primary technique using (at the time) to identify the components of these machines that were going to fail was machine learning and more specifically a reconstruction error approach to data processing.
