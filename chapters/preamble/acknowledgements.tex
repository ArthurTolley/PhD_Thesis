Enough of the big-headedness, there are over a hundred people who have each individually made me the person I am today and without them, their help, conversations, emotional support and even conflict, I would not be here at the end of this (very) long journey.

People: Ian, Andy, Mum, Dad, Lee, Jo, Claire, Vickie, Chris, Akash, Nick, Alex, Jake, Billy, George, Ricky, Muntazim, Connor W, Raf, Dan, Joe, Gareth, Ronaldas, Hooshyar, Christina, Toyah
